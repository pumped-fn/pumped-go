# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo for the Pumped Functions library, a TypeScript functional programming library providing container-based dependency injection and reactive programming patterns.

### When to Use Sub-CLAUDE.md Files

- **packages/next/CLAUDE.md**: Working with core executors, scopes, dependency resolution, reactive patterns
- **packages/react/CLAUDE.md**: React hooks, components, integration patterns, React-specific state management  
- **packages/extra/CLAUDE.md**: Full-stack patterns, client/server utilities, API definitions, telemetry
- **packages/cli/CLAUDE.md**: AST analysis, dependency graph visualization, CLI commands, image generation
- **docs/CLAUDE.md**: Documentation structure, content organization, Next.js documentation site
- **examples/CLAUDE.md**: Example applications, usage patterns, demo implementations

### Core Architecture Concepts

- **Executors**: Containers holding values with dependency resolution (`provide`, `derive`)
- **Scopes**: Lazy resolution contexts managing executor lifecycles (`createScope`)
- **Reactive Programming**: Executors trigger updates when dependencies change (`.reactive`)
- **Meta System**: Type-safe decorative information using StandardSchema (`meta()`)
- **Container Types**: Static, Lazy, Reactive executor variants

## Quick Reference - Common APIs

### Core Executors (`@pumped-fn/core-next`)
- `provide(factory, ...metas)` - Create executor with no dependencies
- `derive(deps, factory, ...metas)` - Create executor with dependencies
- `createScope(...presets)` - Create resolution scope
- `executor.reactive` - Get reactive variant of executor
- `executor.lazy` - Get lazy variant of executor
- `executor.static` - Get static variant of executor

### React Integration (`@pumped-fn/react`)
- `useResolves(...executors)` - Resolve multiple executors in React
- `useResolve(executor, selector)` - Resolve with selector function
- `useUpdate(executor)` - Get update function for executor
- `ScopeProvider` - Provide scope context to React tree
- `<Resolves e={executors}>{values => ...}</Resolves>` - Render prop component

### Full-Stack Utilities (`@pumped-fn/extra`)
- `define.api(spec)` - Define API with input/output schemas
- Client/server utilities for RPC patterns
- Telemetry and logging utilities

## Common Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages (order matters - core first)
pnpm build

# Run tests across all packages  
pnpm test

# Type check all packages
pnpm typecheck

# Format code (uses Biome)
npx biome format --write .

# Full verification pipeline
pnpm verify
```

### Package-Specific Commands
```bash
# Work with individual packages
cd packages/{next|react|extra|cli}

# Build specific package
pnpm build

# Test with watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run specific package tests
pnpm test
```

### Documentation & Release
```bash
# Documentation development
pnpm docs:dev

# Release processes  
pnpm release:patch  # Patch version bump
pnpm release:minor  # Minor version bump
```

## Technical Standards

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** across all packages with consistent configuration
- **@testing-library/react** for React component testing  
- Tests in `tests/` or `test/` directories within each package
- Use `pnpm test` from root or `pnpm test:watch` for individual packages

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict settings, ESM modules throughout
- **Biome**: Code formatting (linting disabled)
- **Node 18+**: Minimum runtime requirement
- **Functional Programming**: Core design philosophy
- **StandardSchema**: Type validation in meta system

### File Conventions
- `src/index.ts` - Main package exports
- `src/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `tests/*.test.ts` - Test files using Vitest
- `package.json` - Contains build/test scripts per package

## Documentation Strategy

### Content Plan Tracking
**IMPORTANT**: Documentation redesign is in progress based on developer relations expert feedback.

Current status tracked in: **`.claude_artifacts/content_plan.md`**

**Key Issues Identified**:
- Documentation suffers from "does everything" syndrome
- Information overload prevents developer adoption
- No clear competitive positioning or value proposition
- Need to focus on single primary use case

**When working on documentation**:
1. âœ… Check `.claude_artifacts/content_plan.md` for current priorities
2. âœ… Follow progressive disclosure principles (simple â†’ complex)
3. âœ… Focus on single use case (dependency injection OR reactive state, not both)
4. âœ… Include competitive comparisons and address adoption barriers
5. âœ… Update checkboxes in content plan as work progresses

**Next Major Updates**:
- Hero section rewrite with concrete problem/solution
- Choose primary use case focus (DI vs reactive state)
- Create comparison page vs existing solutions
- Add FAQ addressing developer concerns
