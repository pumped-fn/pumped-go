    "NEVER use ctx.get() or scope.resolve() inside executors - declare dependencies explicitly in arrays",
    "NEVER escape provide/derive with conditional logic - use .lazy for conditional resolution",

    "Always use derive([deps], ([deps]) => factory) array syntax",
    "Always make dependencies explicit in arrays",
    "Use meta() with standard schema for configuration validation",
    "Return objects with method closures, not class instances",
    "Keep graph depth 3-4 layers max",
    "Depend on abstractions, not implementations",
    "Use scope for long-lived resources, flows for short-lived operations",
