- feat: changed plugin to extension, unified the API for both scope and plugin
- feat: made scope and pod to be MetaContainer. As such, executors and flows can read meta from scope, that'll be the way to configure
- chore: cleanup tests, reduce amount of test bloats
- chore: removed placeholder, prepare and adapt
