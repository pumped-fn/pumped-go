# Pumped-fn, a function on steroid

A dependency injection just made things a little bit way too easy

## hold on, Dependency Injection? are we JAVA yet?

- No, this library is built to make you pumped, enjoy all benefits without being old
- You don't even know that you are using Dependency Injection
- You GOT EVERYTHING, and no string attached

## start in a minute (or maybe a little bit more)

### install that really quickly
