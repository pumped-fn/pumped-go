# Advanced Patterns: Day 2 Operations

**You've mastered the fundamentals.** Executors, scopes, dependencies, and core patterns are second nature. Now it's time for the advanced techniques that separate good backend systems from exceptional ones.

## What Makes This Advanced?

These patterns tackle **Day 2 operations** - the complex scenarios you encounter when your application is running in production, handling real traffic, and evolving with business needs:

ðŸŽ¯ **Reactive Systems**: Configuration that changes at runtime, adaptive resource scaling  
âš¡ **Dynamic Behavior**: Feature flags, A/B testing, progressive rollouts  
ðŸ”¥ **Operational Excellence**: Health monitoring, graceful degradation, circuit breakers  
ðŸš€ **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, resource pooling, smart caching  
ðŸ’Ž **Production Readiness**: Observability, debugging, maintenance operations  

## The Advanced Mindset

### From Static to Dynamic
```typescript
// Beginner: Static configuration
const dbConfig = provide(() => ({ maxConnections: 10 }));

// Advanced: Runtime-adaptive configuration
const dbConfig = derive(
  [environmentMetrics, currentLoad, remoteConfigService],
  ([metrics, load, remote]) => ({
    maxConnections: calculateOptimalConnections(metrics, load, remote.database)
  })
);
```

### From Simple to Resilient
```typescript
// Beginner: Basic service
const userService = derive(database, (db) => new UserService(db));

// Advanced: Resilient service with fallbacks
const userService = derive(
  [primaryDatabase, readReplica, cache, circuitBreaker],
  ([primary, replica, cache, breaker]) => 
    new ResilientUserService(primary, replica, cache, breaker)
);
```

### From Development to Production
```typescript
// Beginner: Works on laptop
const emailService = provide(() => new EmailService());

// Advanced: Production-ready with observability
const emailService = derive(
  [config, logger, metrics, healthChecker, rateLimiter],
  ([config, logger, metrics, health, limiter]) => 
    new ProductionEmailService(config, logger, metrics, health, limiter)
);
```

## Advanced Patterns Overview

### **Reactive Patterns**
Dynamic systems that respond to changing conditions:
- **Live Configuration Management**: Remote config updates without restarts
- **Adaptive Resource Scaling**: Services that scale based on load
- **Feature Flag Orchestration**: Runtime behavior changes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Systems that adapt to their own health metrics

### **Execution Modes Mastery**
Advanced usage of lazy, static, and reactive executors:
- **Lazy Loading Strategies**: Load expensive resources only when needed
- **Static Optimization**: Pre-compute and cache expensive operations
- **Reactive Chains**: Complex reactive dependency networks
- **Mixed Mode Patterns**: Combining execution modes strategically

### **Production Patterns**
Operational excellence for production environments:
- **Health and Observability**: Deep health checking and metrics
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failing gracefully under pressure
- **Resource Management**: Advanced cleanup and resource pooling
- **Debugging and Introspection**: Understanding your running system

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced patterns, ensure you're comfortable with:

âœ… **Core Building Blocks**: Executors, scopes, dependencies  
âœ… **Basic Patterns**: Configuration, testing, async coordination  
âœ… **Scope Management**: Creating, resolving, and disposing scopes  
âœ… **Dependency Injection**: Single, array, and object dependency patterns  
âœ… **Testing Strategies**: Using presets and scope isolation  

## Advanced Learning Path

### 1. Start with Reactivity
Begin with [reactive patterns](/advanced/reactive-patterns) to understand how dynamic systems work. This builds on your foundation with live, changing dependencies.

### 2. Master Execution Modes
Explore [execution modes](/advanced/execution-modes) to understand when and how to use lazy, static, and reactive executors for optimal performance.

### 3. Production Readiness
Learn [production patterns](/advanced/production-patterns) for building systems that thrive under real-world conditions.

### 4. Advanced Architecture
Study [architectural patterns](/advanced/architecture) that combine all techniques for large-scale system design.

## Advanced Principles

### Principle 1: Everything Changes
In production, nothing is static. Configuration changes, load varies, services fail, requirements evolve. Design for change from the beginning.

### Principle 2: Fail Gracefully
Systems will fail. The question is how gracefully. Advanced patterns ensure failures are isolated, logged, and recovered from automatically.

### Principle 3: Observe Everything
You can't manage what you can't measure. Advanced systems provide deep observability into their behavior, performance, and health.

### Principle 4: Optimize Lazily
Don't optimize until you measure. But when you do optimize, lazy loading and reactive updates provide the biggest wins.

### Principle 5: Test in Production
Advanced patterns enable safe testing in production through feature flags, canary deployments, and graceful rollbacks.

Remember: **Advanced patterns solve advanced problems.** Don't use them unless you have the problems they solve. But when you do have those problems, these patterns will be invaluable.
