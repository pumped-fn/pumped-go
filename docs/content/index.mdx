# Pumped Functions

A modern TypeScript functional programming library that provides **container-based dependency injection** and **reactive programming patterns**. Built with type safety and developer experience in mind.

## Why Pumped Functions?

- **ðŸ”§ Container-based DI**: Elegant dependency injection without the complexity
- **âš¡ Reactive Programming**: Built-in reactivity with automatic dependency tracking
- **ðŸŽ¯ Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with excellent inference
- **ðŸ”„ React Integration**: Seamless React hooks and components
- **ðŸ“¦ Modular Design**: Use only what you need
- **ðŸ§ª Testing-First**: Comprehensive testing utilities included

## Key Features

### Executors
Executors are the core building blocks - containers that hold values and define how dependencies are resolved.

```typescript
import { exec } from '@pumped-fn/core-next';

// Simple executor
const greeting = exec(() => 'Hello World!');

// Executor with dependencies
const userGreeting = exec((name: string) => `Hello ${name}!`, name);
```

### Reactive Programming
Built-in reactivity that automatically tracks dependencies and updates when they change.

```typescript
const counter = exec(() => ({ count: 0 }));
const doubled = exec((state) => state.count * 2, counter.reactive);
```

### React Integration
Seamless integration with React components using hooks and providers.

```typescript
import { useResolves, ScopeProvider } from '@pumped-fn/react';

function App() {
  const [greeting, count] = useResolves(greeting, counter);
  return <div>{greeting} - Count: {count.count}</div>;
}
```
