# Installation

Get started with Pumped Functions by installing the core package and any additional packages you need.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**: Pumped Functions requires Node.js version 18 or higher
- **TypeScript**: While not required, TypeScript is highly recommended for the best experience

## Package Manager

Pumped Functions works with all major package managers:

**pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add @pumped-fn/core-next
```

**npm:**
```bash
npm install @pumped-fn/core-next
```

**yarn:**
```bash
yarn add @pumped-fn/core-next
```

## Core Package

The core package provides all the fundamental functionality:

```bash
# Core library with executors, scopes, and reactive programming
pnpm add @pumped-fn/core-next
```

**What's included:**
- Executors (containers for values and dependencies)
- Scopes (resolution contexts)
- Reactive programming utilities
- Meta system for type validation
- Helper functions and utilities

## React Integration

For React applications, install the React bindings:

**pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add @pumped-fn/react
```

**npm:**
```bash
npm install @pumped-fn/react
```

**yarn:**
```bash
yarn add @pumped-fn/react
```

**What's included:**
- React hooks (`useResolves`, `useResolve`, `useUpdate`)
- React components (`ScopeProvider`, `Resolves`, `Reselect`)
- Automatic reactivity with React's concurrent features
- Server-side rendering support

## Additional Utilities

For full-stack applications, consider the extra utilities:

**pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add @pumped-fn/extra
```

**npm:**
```bash
npm install @pumped-fn/extra
```

**yarn:**
```bash
yarn add @pumped-fn/extra
```

## Development Setup

For development, you might want to install additional tools:

**pnpm:**
```bash
# TypeScript (if not already installed)
pnpm add -D typescript

# Testing utilities
pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

**npm:**
```bash
# TypeScript (if not already installed)
npm install -D typescript

# Testing utilities
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

**yarn:**
```bash
# TypeScript (if not already installed)
yarn add -D typescript

# Testing utilities
yarn add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

## TypeScript Configuration

For the best TypeScript experience, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  }
}
```

## Verification

Verify your installation by creating a simple test:

```typescript
import { exec, createScope } from '@pumped-fn/core-next';

// Create a simple executor
const greeting = exec(() => 'Hello from Pumped Functions!');

// Create a scope and resolve the executor
const scope = createScope();
const result = scope.resolve(greeting);

console.log(result); // "Hello from Pumped Functions!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Module not found errors:**
- Ensure you're using Node.js 18+
- Check that your package manager installed the dependencies correctly
- Verify your TypeScript configuration supports ES modules

**Type errors:**
- Make sure TypeScript is configured with `strict: true`
- Install type definitions for React if using the React package
- Check that your `moduleResolution` is set to `"bundler"` or `"node"`
