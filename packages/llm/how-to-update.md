## 🔄 Update Methodology

### **Phase 1: Assessment (Monthly)**

#### **1.1 Performance Testing**
```bash
# Run AI comprehension tests
npm run llm:test-comprehension

# Check against benchmark suite
npm run llm:benchmark

# Analyze failure patterns
npm run llm:analyze-failures
```

#### **1.2 Competitive Analysis**
Monitor instruction sets from similar libraries:
- **React**: Documentation patterns, example structures
- **Zustand**: State management teaching approaches
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming explanations
- **Solid**: Modern library instruction techniques

#### **1.3 User Feedback Analysis**
Track issues from:
- GitHub issues mentioning "confusing", "unclear", "how to"
- Community Discord questions
- AI model output quality reports

### **Phase 2: Content Audit (Bi-weekly)**

#### **2.1 Structural Health Check**
```
□ Mental Model (7-15%): Core concepts front-loaded?
□ Quick Reference (10-15%): API scannable in 30 seconds?
□ Essential Patterns (30-40%): Working examples for all use cases?
□ Anti-Patterns (15-20%): Top mistakes covered with solutions?
□ Advanced (15-20%): Edge cases and performance tips?
□ Templates (10-15%): Copy-paste ready starters?
```

#### **2.2 Content Quality Audit**
For each section, verify:
- **Accuracy**: Code examples compile and run
- **Completeness**: All imports, no missing context
- **Clarity**: Single concept per example
- **Brevity**: Minimal viable demonstration

#### **2.3 Example Efficiency Review**
```
□ Each example teaches 1 clear concept
□ No redundant examples (different ways to show same thing)
□ Progressive complexity (simple → real-world → advanced)
□ High impact:line ratio (max teaching per code line)
```

### **Phase 3: Update Execution**

#### **3.1 Content Updates (As Needed)**

**When to Update:**
- New major library features (version bumps)
- Identified AI confusion patterns (>5 similar failures)
- Competitive instruction sets show better techniques
- Performance metrics drop below targets

**Update Priorities:**
1. **Critical Path**: Mental Model + Quick Reference (80% of AI usage)
2. **Common Patterns**: Essential Patterns section
3. **Error Prevention**: Anti-Patterns section
4. **Edge Cases**: Advanced patterns

#### **3.2 Structural Improvements**

**Example Compression Techniques:**
```markdown
# Before (verbose)
Example 1: Basic counter (15 lines)
Example 2: Counter with reset (18 lines)
Example 3: Counter with validation (22 lines)

# After (compressed)
Base Pattern: Counter (12 lines)
// Variations:
// + Reset: add reset() method
// + Validation: wrap update with validation
```

**Context Enhancement Patterns:**
```markdown
# Add decision triggers
🟢 **Use when**: Simple state + display needs
🟡 **Use when**: Multiple state sources with dependencies
🔴 **Use when**: Complex TUI apps with circular deps

# Add cross-references
👉 **See also**: Pattern 2 for cleanup, Advanced section for TUI
```

## 🏁 Competitive Benchmarking

### **Benchmark Against Industry Standards**

#### **Documentation Leaders to Study:**
1. **Svelte Tutorial**: Progressive complexity, interactive examples
2. **Vue Guide**: Clear mental models, decision trees
3. **React Docs**: Common patterns, troubleshooting
4. **Zustand README**: Minimal examples, maximum clarity

#### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Time to First Success**: How fast can AI generate working code?
- **Error Rate**: What % of generated code has bugs?
- **Pattern Adoption**: Does AI use library idioms correctly?
- **Complexity Handling**: Can AI build advanced applications?

#### **Monthly Competitive Review Questions:**
```
□ Are our examples shorter than competitors while maintaining clarity?
□ Do we explain the "why" better than alternatives?
□ Are our anti-patterns more comprehensive?
□ Do our templates cover more use cases?
□ Is our decision guidance clearer?
```

### **AI Model Evolution Tracking**

As AI models improve, instruction requirements change:

**Current Gen (GPT-4, Claude)**: Need explicit anti-patterns, detailed examples
**Next Gen (GPT-5+)**: May prefer conceptual frameworks, less hand-holding

**Adaptation Strategy:**
- **Version A**: Current detailed approach
- **Version B**: More conceptual, less prescriptive
- **A/B Test**: Compare AI performance on both versions
- **Migrate**: Gradually adopt better-performing approach
