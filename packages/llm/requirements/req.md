# Terminal Time Display Application - Requirements Specification

## Overview

A terminal-based real-time clock application that provides customizable time display options with interactive keyboard controls. The application demonstrates modern software architecture patterns through reactive state management and clean separation of concerns.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Time Display System

#### 1.1 Real-Time Clock

- Display current time with automatic updates every 1000 milliseconds
- Support for both local system time and international timezones
- Continuous operation until user termination

#### 1.2 Time Format Options

The application must support the following time formats:

1. **24-hour format**: HH:MM:SS (e.g., "14:30:45")
2. **12-hour format**: HH:MM:SS AM/PM (e.g., "02:30:45 PM")
3. **ISO 8601**: HH:MM:SS (e.g., "14:30:45")
4. **Unix Timestamp**: Seconds since epoch (e.g., "1703851845")
5. **Full Date Time**: Day, Month DD, YYYY HH:MM:SS (e.g., "Mon, Dec 29, 2023 14:30:45")
6. **Milliseconds**: HH:MM:SS.mmm (e.g., "14:30:45.123")

#### 1.3 Timezone Support

The application must support the following timezones:

1. Local (system timezone)
2. UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
3. America/New_York (Eastern Time)
4. America/Los_Angeles (Pacific Time)
5. America/Chicago (Central Time)
6. Europe/London (GMT/BST)
7. Europe/Paris (CET/CEST)
8. Asia/Tokyo (JST)
9. Australia/Sydney (AEST/AEDT)
10. Asia/Kolkata (IST)

### 2. User Interface Requirements

#### 2.1 Visual Frame Styles

The application must support the following display frame styles:

1. **Classic Box**: ┌─┐│└─┘
2. **Double Line**: ╔═╗║╚═╝
3. **Rounded**: ╭─╮│╰─╯
4. **ASCII Simple**: +─+|+─+
5. **Stars**: **\***
6. **Dots**: ·····
7. **Heavy**: ┏━┓┃┗━┛
8. **Dashed**: ┌┄┐┆└┄┘
9. **None**: No frame (plain text)

#### 2.2 Content Layout

- Display current time in selected format
- Show currently selected timezone name
- Show currently selected format name
- Show currently selected frame style name
- Optional help panel overlay

#### 2.3 Terminal Display

- Full-screen terminal interface
- **CRITICAL**: Flicker-free rendering using cursor positioning instead of full screen clears
- Proper content centering and padding
- ANSI escape codes for screen control
- Diff-based rendering to minimize terminal output

### 3. User Interaction Requirements

#### 3.1 Keyboard Controls

The application must respond to the following keyboard inputs:

- **z/Z**: Cycle timezone forward/backward
- **f/F**: Cycle time format forward/backward
- **s/S**: Cycle frame style forward/backward
- **h**: Toggle help display on/off
- **q**: Quit application
- **Ctrl+C**: Force quit application

#### 3.2 Input Handling

- Raw mode terminal input for immediate response
- Case-sensitive controls (lowercase vs uppercase for direction)
- Bidirectional cycling (forward and backward through options)
- Graceful handling of invalid input (ignore unrecognized keys)

#### 3.3 Help System

- Toggle help panel showing all keyboard shortcuts
- Help text includes:
  - List of all available commands
  - Brief description of each control
  - Instructions for hiding help
  - Quit instructions

### 4. System Integration Requirements

#### 4.1 Process Management

- Handle system signals gracefully (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- Display shutdown message during graceful termination
- Clean resource disposal on exit
- Proper terminal state restoration

#### 4.2 Resource Management

- Timer-based updates using system intervals
- Memory-efficient state management
- Clean disposal of timers and event listeners
- Terminal mode restoration on exit

#### 4.3 Error Handling

- Graceful handling of timezone resolution errors
- Terminal capability detection
- Fallback display modes for unsupported terminals
- Proper error reporting without breaking UI

### 5. State Management Requirements

#### 5.1 Configuration State

The application must maintain the following runtime configuration:

- Selected timezone index (0-9)
- Selected time format index (0-5)
- Selected frame style index (0-8)
- Help display visibility (boolean)
- Update interval setting (1000ms default)

#### 5.2 Reactive Updates

- Automatic UI refresh when any configuration changes
- Immediate visual feedback for user actions
- Consistent state across all display components
- No manual refresh required

#### 5.3 State Persistence

- Configuration maintained throughout application lifetime
- Settings reset to defaults on restart
- No persistent storage required (session-based only)

### 6. Architecture Requirements

#### 6.1 Separation of Concerns

The application should be structured with clear separation between:

- **Time Management**: Clock updates and time source control
- **Configuration Management**: User settings and state updates
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard event processing
- **Display Rendering**: UI formatting and terminal output
- **Application Coordination**: Overall lifecycle and component integration

#### 6.2 Component Interaction

- Components should communicate through well-defined interfaces
- State changes should propagate automatically to dependent components
- Components should be independently testable
- Clear dependency relationships between components

#### 6.3 Lifecycle Management

- Proper initialization sequence
- Clean startup and shutdown procedures
- Resource acquisition and disposal
- Error boundary handling

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Sub-100ms response time for user input
- Minimal CPU usage during idle periods
- Efficient memory usage with no memory leaks
- Smooth display updates without flicker

### Compatibility

- Support for standard POSIX terminals
- Compatible with common terminal emulators
- Graceful degradation on limited terminals
- Cross-platform terminal support

### Usability

- Intuitive keyboard shortcuts
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Minimal learning curve
- Accessible help system

### Reliability

- Stable operation for extended periods
- Graceful error recovery
- Consistent behavior across different environments
- Predictable response to user actions

## Success Criteria

The application is considered successful when:

1. All time formats display correctly in all supported timezones
2. All keyboard controls work reliably and responsively
3. UI updates smoothly without visual artifacts
4. Application starts and shuts down cleanly
5. Resource usage remains stable during extended operation
6. Help system provides clear guidance for all features
7. Application handles edge cases and errors gracefully

## Implementation Notes

This specification is framework and library agnostic. The requirements can be implemented using any programming language and architecture that supports:

- Terminal I/O and ANSI control codes
- Keyboard input handling in raw mode
- Timer-based operations
- Signal handling
- No screen flashing/flickering
- Clear help text displaying all the time
- Smooth operations/transitions
